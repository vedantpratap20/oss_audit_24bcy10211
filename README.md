# Open Source Audit: VLC Media Player

**Course:** Open Source Software (NGMC)
**Student:** Vedant Pratap Singh | **Registration:** 24BCY10211
**Slot:** d11 | **Date:** 31/03/2026

## Why VLC?
I chose VLC Media Player for this audit because of its awesome history starting as a student project at a French university. It also has an interesting dual-license setup (GPL for the app, LGPL for the core engine) and is one of the most downloaded open-source apps ever.

## Script Breakdown

### 1. System Identity Report (`script1_system_identity.sh`)
This script just prints out a welcome screen with my basic system info like the Linux distro, kernel version, who is logged in, uptime, and the current date/time. It also mentions the OS license. I used basic bash variables, command substitution (like `$(whoami)`), and `echo` to format the output nicely.

### 2. Package Inspector (`script2_package_inspector.sh`)
I wrote this to check if a specific open-source package (like VLC) is installed. It automatically detects if you're using `rpm` (Fedora/RedHat) or `dpkg` (Ubuntu/Debian) to do the check. Then it grabs the package version and prints a quick philosophical note depending on the software. It makes heavy use of `if/else`, `case` statements, and piping data into `grep`.

### 3. Disk & Permission Auditor (`script3_disk_permission_auditor.sh`)
This one loops through important directories (like `/etc`, `/var/log`, `/home`) and checks their permissions, owner, and size. It also specifically looks for VLC's plugin and config folders to see how much space they take up. It relies on standard `for` loops, `ls -ld`, `du`, and `awk` to chop up the output.

### 4. Log Analyzer (`script4_log_analyzer.sh`)
A handy script to scan through a log file and count how many times a word (like `error`) shows up. If it finds matches, it prints the last 5 of them. I also added a retry loop so if the file is empty when you run it, it waits a bit and tries again before giving up. Takes command-line arguments (e.g., `$1` and `$2`).

### 5. Manifesto Generator (`script5_manifesto_generator.sh`)
An interactive script! It asks you 3 quick questions using `read -p`. Based on what you type, it generates a personalized text file (`manifesto_[your_username].txt`) with a short open-source philosophy statement. Shows off string appending and writing output to files.

## How to run them

### What you need
- A Linux box (I tested this on Ubuntu).
- Bash shell.
- VLC installed (if you want Scripts 2 and 3 to show everything).

### Steps
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdityaTiwari64/oss-audit-24BCY10211.git
   cd oss-audit-24BCY10211/scripts
   ```

2. **Give them execute permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. **Run them!**
   - **Script 1:** `./script1_system_identity.sh`
   - **Script 2:** `./script2_package_inspector.sh` (Checks for VLC by default, but you can edit the script to check others).
   - **Script 3:** `./script3_disk_permission_auditor.sh` (Might need `sudo` to see the sizes of some restricted folders like `/var/log`).
   - **Script 4:** `./script4_log_analyzer.sh /var/log/syslog error` (You can swap `error` for `WARNING` or whatever you're looking for).
   - **Script 5:** `./script5_manifesto_generator.sh` (Just answer the prompts).

## Tools Used
All the scripts run on default Linux tools (`uname`, `date`, `whoami`, `grep`, `awk`, `cut`, `du`, `find`, `tail`, `cat`). No crazy external dependencies.
If you want to install VLC to get the full output for Scripts 2 and 3, run:
`sudo apt install vlc` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install vlc` (Fedora).
